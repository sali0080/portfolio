# Web Dev Portfolio README

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my web portfolio, showcasing my work in web development, digital graphics, and photography.

## Development Process

When developing my web portfolio, I encountered several challenges:

- **HTML Coding:** Initially, coding the HTML was straightforward.
- **Bootstrap Integration:** Integrating Bootstrap presented difficulties, particularly in styling it with CSS.
  
To overcome these hurdles, I tapped into available resources and sought support and feedback from peers. Through this collaborative effort, I successfully navigated through the challenges.

## Lessons Learned

Creating my web portfolio taught me valuable lessons:

- **Diverse Approaches:** I gained a deeper understanding of the diverse approaches to website development.
- **Preferred Method:** I discovered that the method I employed might be my preferred one moving forward.


## Changed Features

- **User Experience Improvements:**
  - **Social Icons:** Changed to social media platforms I actually use.
  - **Hamburger Menu:** Removed as it confused users about the availability of additional content.
  - **Home Page Layout:** Replaced static work demo with a carousel slide for better presentation.
  - **Graphic Elements:** Removed palm tree leaves and flowers to focus solely on my own digital graphics work.
  - **Footer Navigation:** Made footer navigation easier by centering all elements.

## Development Process

During development, I incorporated feedback received from my peers regarding user experience improvements. By addressing their considerations and making necessary adjustments, I aimed to enhance the overall usability and clarity of my web portfolio.

## Animation

Animation has been implemented on all buttons throughout the website to enhance user interaction and engagement. This includes subtle hover effects to indicate clickable elements and smooth transitions when buttons are clicked.
